# Final-project

Welcome to Spirit! The website where you discover your spirit animal and then bond with it through various games and activities.

1. The first step is to sign up and take the personality quiz. Then using a comparison algorithm we determine which spirit animal is a best match for you. Now, on to meet your new companion.

2. Once you have your animal you need to keep them happy. Feed it when it's hungry and play with it when it's bored. If you run out of food, just go forage for more.

This application uses several different libraries and technologies. The user authentication is a Passport Local strategy with password encryption. The data is all stored in a mySQL database and the app makes several different api calls to the database. Finally, the animation library we used was easelJS from the createJS library.
